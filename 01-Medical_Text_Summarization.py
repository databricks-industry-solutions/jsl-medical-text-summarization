# MAGIC # ü™Ñ Medical Text Summarization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üîé Text Summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves condensing a lengthy text document into a shorter, more compact version while still retaining the most important information and meaning. The goal is to produce a summary that accurately represents the content of the original text in a concise form.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üîéThere are `different approaches` to text summarization, including `extractive methods that` identify and extract important sentences or phrases from the text, and `abstractive methods` that generate new text based on the content of the original text.

Two hours prior to presentation, he started to fall and someone stepped on his ankle and kind of twisted his right ankle and he cannot bear weight on it now. It hurts to move or bear weight. No other injuries noted. He does not think he has had injuries to his ankle in the past.
SOCIAL HISTORY: He does not drink or smoke.
MEDICAL DECISION MAKING:
He had an x-ray of his ankle that showed a small ossicle versus avulsion fracture of the talonavicular joint on the lateral view. He has had no pain over the metatarsals themselves. This may be a fracture based upon his exam. He does want to have me to put him in a splint. He was given Motrin here. He will be discharged home to follow up with Dr. X from Orthopedics.
DISPOSITION: Crutches and splint were administered here. I gave him a prescription for Motrin and some Darvocet if he needs to length his sleep and if he has continued pain to follow up with Dr. X. Return if any worsening problems."""

He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84. He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident. His extremities are symmetrical with no edema. His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.

PLAN: He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics. We will get an ultrasound this morning. He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further. The patient understands."""

She is 5'6" tall and weighs 267 pounds. She is motivated to attempt surgical weight loss because she has been overweight for over 20 years and wants to have more energy and improve her self-image. She is not only affected physically, but also socially by her weight. When she loses weight she always regains it and she always gains back more weight than she has lost. At one time, she lost 100 pounds and gained the weight back within a year. She has tried numerous commercial weight loss programs including Weight Watcher's for four months in 1992 with 15-pound weight loss, RS for two months in 1990 with six-pound weight loss, Slim Fast for six weeks in 2004 with eight-pound weight loss, an exercise program for two months in 2007 with a five-pound weight loss, Atkin's Diet for three months in 2008 with a ten-pound weight loss, and Dexatrim for one month in 2005 with a five-pound weight loss. She has also tried numerous fat reduction or fad diets. She was on Redux for nine months with a 100-pound weight loss.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY: She has a history of hypertension and shortness of breath.\n\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Pertinent for cholecystectomy.\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL HISTORY: Negative.\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: She is single. She drinks alcohol once a week. She does not smoke.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: Pertinent for obesity and hypertension.\n\nMEDICATIONS: Include Topamax 100 mg twice daily, Zoloft 100 mg twice daily, Abilify 5 mg daily, Motrin 800 mg daily, and a multivitamin.\n\nALLERGIES: She has no known drug allergies.\n\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Negative.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: This is a pleasant female in no acute distress. Alert and oriented x 3. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Extraocular muscles intact, nonicteric sclerae. Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular is normal sinus rhythm. Abdomen is obese, soft, nontender and nondistended. Extremities show no edema, clubbing or cyanosis.\n\nASSESSMENT/PLAN: This is a 34-year-old female with a BMI of 43 who is interested in surgical weight via the gastric bypass as opposed to Lap-Band. Olivia Smith will be asking for a letter of medical necessity from Dr. Andrew Johnson. She will also see my nutritionist and social worker and have an upper endoscopy. Once this is completed, we will submit her to her insurance company for approval.
