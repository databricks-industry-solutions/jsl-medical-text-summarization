# MAGIC # ü™Ñ Medical Text Summarization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üîé Text Summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves condensing a lengthy text document into a shorter, more compact version while still retaining the most important information and meaning. The goal is to produce a summary that accurately represents the content of the original text in a concise form.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üîéThere are `different approaches` to text summarization, including `extractive methods that` identify and extract important sentences or phrases from the text, and `abstractive methods` that generate new text based on the content of the original text.

He has lost about 200 pounds and was otherwise doing well until yesterday evening around 7:00-8:00 when he developed nausea and right upper quadrant pain, which apparently wrapped around toward his right side and back. He feels like he was on it but has not done so. He has overall malaise and a low-grade temperature of 100.3. He denies any prior similar or lesser symptoms. His last normal bowel movement was yesterday. He denies any outright chills or blood per rectum.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: His temperature is 100.3, blood pressure 129/59, respirations 16, heart rate 84. He is drowsy, but easily arousable and appropriate with conversation. He is oriented to person, place, and situation. He is normocephalic, atraumatic. His sclerae are anicteric. His mucous membranes are somewhat tacky. His neck is supple and symmetric. His respirations are unlabored and clear. He has a regular rate and rhythm. His abdomen is soft. He has diffuse right upper quadrant tenderness, worse focally, but no rebound or guarding. He otherwise has no organomegaly, masses, or abdominal hernias evident. His extremities are symmetrical with no edema. His posterior tibial pulses are palpable and symmetric. He is grossly nonfocal neurologically.

PLAN: He will be admitted and placed on IV antibiotics. We will get an ultrasound this morning. He will need his gallbladder out, probably with intraoperative cholangiogram. Hopefully, the stone will pass this way. Due to his anatomy, an ERCP would prove quite difficult if not impossible unless laparoscopic assisted. Dr. X will see him later this morning and discuss the plan further. The patient understands."""

# MAGIC **We've Made Significant Enhancements To Our Text Summarization Method, Which Now Utilizes A Map-Reduce Approach For Section-Wise Summarization.**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We are excited to announce the integration of new parameters into our `MedicalSummarizer` annotator, empowering users to overcome token limitations and attain heightened flexibility in their medical summarization endeavors. These advanced parameters significantly augment the annotator's functionality, enabling users to generate more accurate and comprehensive summaries of medical documents. By employing a map-reduce approach, the `MedicalSummarizer` efficiently condenses distinct text segments until the desired length is achieved.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following parameters have been introduced:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - `setRefineSummary`: Set to True for refined summarization with increased computational cost.
# MAGIC - `setRefineSummaryTargetLength`: Define the target length of summarizations in tokens (delimited by whitespace). Effective only when setRefineSummary=True.
# MAGIC - `setRefineChunkSize`: Specify the desired size of refined chunks. Should correspond to the LLM context window size in tokens. Effective only when - `setRefineSummary=True`.
# MAGIC - `setRefineMaxAttempts`: Determine the number of attempts for re-summarizing chunks exceeding the setRefineSummaryTargetLength before discontinuing. Effective only when `setRefineSummary=True`.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC These enhancements to the MedicalSummarizer annotator represent our ongoing commitment to providing state-of-the-art tools for healthcare professionals and researchers, facilitating more efficient and accurate medical text analysis.

text = """To determine whether a course of low-dose indomethacin therapy, when initiated within 24 hours of birth, would decrease ductal shunting in premature infants who received prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room. Ninety infants, with birth weights of 600 to 1250 gm, were entered into a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to receive either indomethacin, 0.1 mg/kg per dose, or placebo less than 24 hours and again every 24 hours for six doses. Echocardiography was performed on day 1 before treatment and on day 7, 24 hours after treatment. A hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was confirmed with an out-of-study echocardiogram, and the nonresponders were treated with standard indomethacin or ligation. Forty-three infants received indomethacin (birth weight, 915 +/- 209 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.6 weeks; 25 boys), and 47 received placebo (birth weight, 879 +/- 202 gm; gestational age, 26.4 +/- 1.8 weeks; 22 boys) (P = not significant). Of 90 infants, 77 (86%) had a PDA by echocardiogram on the first day of life before study treatment; 84% of these PDAs were moderate or large in size in the indomethacin-treated group compared with 93% in the placebo group. Nine of forty indomethacin-treated infants (21%) were study-dose nonresponders compared with 22 (47%) of 47 placebo-treated infants (p < 0.018). There were no significant differences between both groups in any of the long-term outcome variables, including intraventricular hemorrhage, duration of oxygen therapy, endotracheal intubation, duration of stay in neonatal intensive care unit, time to regain birth weight or reach full caloric intake, incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and survival. No significant differences were noted in the incidence of oliguria, elevated plasma creatinine concentration, thrombocytopenia, pulmonary hemorrhage, or necrotizing enterocolitis. The prophylactic use of low doses of indomethacin, when initiated in the first 24 hours of life in low birth weight infants who receive prophylactic surfactant in the delivery room, decreases the incidence of left-to-right shunting at the level of the ductus arteriosus."""
